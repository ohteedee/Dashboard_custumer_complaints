# Dashboard_custumer_complaints

The dashboard is an interactive dashboard that I designed in Tableau desktop and published in Tableau public. 
You can take a look and interact with this dashboard on [tableau public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tosin.oyewale/viz/customercomplaints_16429891742820/Dashboard2?publish=yes)

<br />
The dashboard was created using dataset from [data.world](https://data.world/). 
If you sign up, you can get access to the data [here](https://data.world/markbradbourne/rwfd-real-world-fake-data/workspace/file?filename=Financial+Consumer+Complaints.csv). 
I connected tablue server to the api of data.world. 
Therefore, if there is a update on the dataset in the future, the dashboard will also be updated
